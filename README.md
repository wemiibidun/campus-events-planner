## Introduction
Campus Events Planner is a front‑end scheduling tool that lets users build a custom calendar grid, add campus events, and manage schedules in one place.

## Technologies
* HTML — layout structure
* CSS — modern dashboard styling
* JavaScript — calendar generation, event actions, and state
* LocalStorage — saved events between sessions

## Features
* Build a custom calendar grid (rows + columns)
* Add and remove events per day
* Event badges with automatic counts
* Slide‑in event panel for a clean workflow
* LocalStorage persistence

## How It Works
1. Enter rows and columns to generate your calendar.
2. Click “Manage” on any day to add events.
3. Events appear in the side panel and as badges on the grid.
4. Data is saved locally so it stays after refresh.
